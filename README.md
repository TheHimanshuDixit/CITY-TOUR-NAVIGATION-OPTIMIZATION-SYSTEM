## BACKGROUND
Why is it essential to have a guidance system at unknown places? <br>
I think we can agree that when traveling, we would want to
experience the place as best and as much as possible. One way to
help you with that is having the guidance system for the we are
visiting. <br>
Traveling is fun, but can sometimes be challenging. Many
countries are very different from the states. That's why it can be
more difficult and challenging if you are traveling abroad because
things are so different and you are not used to them. With the
language, culture and system differences, it can be really confusing
and overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been before. <br>
It’s fine if you want to visit the generic major tourist destinations
with big crowds, but don’t you want to experience the off-thebeaten-
track spots or have more local experience?<br>
That why is becomes important to have a guidance system for
unknown places, as it not only helps you
To find different location easily but it also saves your time and cost.
